# Weather App

A simple web application built with Flask that allows users to get weather information by providing a location. The app uses web scraping to fetch real-time weather data from Google and displays the temperature and weather description. Users can enter a location, click "Get Weather", and view the weather information without leaving the page. The app also includes a loading indicator to provide feedback while the weather data is being fetched.
